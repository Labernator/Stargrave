            "description": "When the old empires fell, so did their laws limiting ‘genetic enhancement’. A few scientists seized this opportunity to engage in radical experimentation. This involved both the genetic manipulation of naturally born individuals and the creation of wholly new ‘tankborn’ individuals. In either case, those that survived these experiments often had unique abilities to control their own bodies, such as realigning their skeletal structure, growing new limbs, changing their skin tones, or even growing additional organs to deal with toxic substances or alien environments. Unfortunately, many biomorphs were also left psychically scarred by their modifications. While the worst of these tend to destroy themselves quickly, almost all carry some form of phobia, psychosis, or other mental impairment.\n\nDepending on the abilities of a biomorph, they tend to dress in loose, or very stretchy outfits, or have specialized suits of armour made that take into account their abilities. More than any other background, biomorphs tend to form independent crews because they are on the run – either from those that created them or want to do further experiments on them, or to escape the consequences of some crime (often unintended)."

Specialist cyborgs have been created to fulfil nearly every military role including infiltration, stealth, reconnaissance, or just straight-up combat. Despite their obvious advantages, cyborgs are rarely cost effective and thus were never produced in great numbers.\n\nWith the end of the Last War, many cyborgs attempted to ‘retire’, but most found that it requires huge sums of money to keep their bodies working. For that reason, many have gone into business for themselves, working as mercenaries, bounty hunters, private investigators, or retrieval specialists.\n\nCyborgs vary greatly in appearance. Some are indistinguishable from humans, some look like humans with obvious robotic parts, and a few look completely robotic and only feature a human brain or nervous system."

            "description": "As the galaxy exploded during the Last War, many people turned to religion to try to find solace. The first, and most obvious, expression of this was the doomsday cults. Some of these grew out of ancient orders that could trace their origins back for millennia; others seemed to spontaneously germinate from the apocalyptic death-tolls. Most of these cults were quickly exterminated or destroyed themselves, but a few survived and even thrived. By mixing mysticism, alien technology, and ‘dark science’, these surviving cults developed strange and deadly powers. While not all of them are ‘evil’, most people look upon these cultists as witches and warlocks and they are rarely welcome. These cult mystics tend to travel between the stars searching for various things: ancient mystical texts, alien technology, or new secrets of dark science.\n\nThere was also a quieter reaction to the war, the flourishing of monastic orders. While these orders have wildly differing foci, from healing to research, historical preservation, even military prowess, they all believe in the establishment and maintenance of order. It is not unusual for a monastery to take the surrounding towns and villages under their protection, and because of this, these areas have often become havens in this dark time.\n\nIn order to join one of these orders, an aspirant must demonstrate a deep connectedness to the universe around them. It is unknown if this is the result of some physiological attribute or simply an open-mindedness to the possibilities beyond sight. Either way, it has allowed these mystics to develop abilities that seem to go beyond the normal bounds of physics.\n\nWhether a cultist, monk, or even knight, these mystics generally wear loose, nondescript clothing, often robes. While armour is worn by a few of the more military focused monastic orders, it seems to interfere with the abilities of most mystics."

Not only that, but they are able to network these robots together in ways that other people can’t even begin to understand. It is not unusual for a robotics expert captain to have more robots than people in their crew, and such crews tend to operate together with a high degree of efficiency.\n\nRobotics Experts are always looking for new technology, and more funds, to improve their robots and push the bounds of what is possible. This leads many to become mercenaries and smugglers. Robotics Experts tend to focus on their work and are unconcerned with their appearance. They generally carry a lot of tools and spare parts for their ‘children’."

Some can move objects or conjure fire, while others can enter people’s minds and potentially control their bodies. Because of their rare abilities, psionicists are actively recruited by the pirate fleets, and those that will not join up willingly are often kidnapped. Thus, the life of a psionicist is inherently dangerous, leading many to live a life on the run, forming their own independent crews to fight against, or at least stay one step ahead of, the pirate fleets.\n\nPsionicists tend to keep a low-profile and thus wear ‘normal clothes’. That said, many shave their heads as their hair becomes itchy when using their powers. Many also feel compelled to sketch very specific, unique tattoos on their bodies, though the reasons for this have never been understood. Psionicists rarely wear armour as it can impair their abilities."
